# Django works with MVT architecture.
# MVT stands for Model, View and Template
# Model is the place where we define our database tables
# View is the place where we write function/classes (logical codes)
# Template is place where we write our html code.

# Unlike Django, Laravel (PHP framework) works in MVC architecture
